# heart-failure-prediction-via-clustering
The *Heart Failure Prediction Dataset* is a well-known Kaggle dataset commonly used as a benchmark for binary classification. In this work, we pursue the same predictive goal but without relying on the provided labels, thereby framing the task as an unsupervised learning problem. We'll use clustering methods to do so.
